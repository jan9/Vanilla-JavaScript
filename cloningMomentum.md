# Google Web Application - Momentum Cloning
## March 2019
### This is a clone of Momentum (a google web application) I made to practice JavaScript.

### This web application has following features:
* 24 hour clock
* Add and recall a user's name (localStorage API)
* Simple to do list (localStorage API)
* User's current location (openweathermap API)
* User's current temperature (openweathermap API)
